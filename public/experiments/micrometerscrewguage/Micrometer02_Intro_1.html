    Measurement of length and time<br>

    <h2>
      Description
    </h2>
    Play with the Micrometer Model. Test what you've learned by trying the 
    input field.<br><br>Micrometers use the principle of a screw to amplify 
    small distances that are too small to measure directly into large 
    rotations of the screw that are big enough to read from a scale. The 
    accuracy of a micrometer derives from the accuracy of the thread form that 
    is at its heart. The basic operating principles of a micrometer are as 
    follows:<br><br>The amount of rotation of an accurately made screw can be 
    directly and precisely correlated to a certain amount of axial movement 
    (and vice-versa), through the constant known as the screw's lead. A 
    screw's lead is the distance it moves forward axially with one complete 
    turn (360&#176;). (In most threads [that is, in all single-start threads], lead 
    and pitch refer to essentially the same concept.)<br><br>With an 
    appropriate lead and major diameter of the screw, a given amount of axial 
    movement will be amplified in the resulting circumferential movement.<br><br>The 
    micrometer has most functional physical parts of a real micrometer.<br><br>Frame 
    (Orange)<br><br>The C-shaped body that holds the anvil and barrel in 
    constant relation to each other. It is thick because it needs to minimize 
    expansion, and contraction, which would distort the measurement. The frame 
    is heavy and consequently has a high thermal mass, to prevent substantial 
    heating up by the holding hand/fingers. has a text 0.01 mm for smallest 
    division of instrument has a text 2 rounds = 100 = 1.00 mm to allow 
    association to actual micrometer<br><br>Anvil (Gray)<br><br>The shiny part 
    that the spindle moves toward, and that the sample rests against.<br><br>Sleeve 
    / barrel / stock (Yellow)<br><br>The stationary round part with the linear 
    scale on it. Sometimes vernier markings.<br><br>Lock nut / lock-ring / 
    thimble lock (Blue)<br><br>The knurled part (or lever) that one can 
    tighten to hold the spindle stationary, such as when momentarily holding a 
    measurement.<br><br>Screw<br><br>(not seen) The heart of the micrometer It 
    is inside the barrel.<br><br>Spindle (Dark Green)<br><br>The shiny 
    cylindrical part that the thimble causes to move toward the anvil.<br><br>Thimble 
    (Green)<br><br>The part that one's thumb turns. Graduated markings.<br><br>Ratchet 
    (Teal)<br><br>(not shown ) Device on end of handle that limits applied 
    pressure by slipping at a calibrated torque.<br><br>This applet has an 
    object (Black)<br><br>with slider on left top to control the y-motion of 
    the object into the anvil and spindle (jaws), the graphics also allows 
    drag action.<br><br>with slider on left bottom to control the x-size of 
    the object into the anvil and spindle (jaws).<br><br>On the left bottom 
    slider is the zero error control to allow of exploring with if the 
    micrometer has either +0.15 mm (max) or -0.15mm (min) zero error. The are 
    check boxes:<br><br>hint: guide lines and arrows to indicate the region of 
    interest plus the accompanying rationale for the answer.<br><br>answer: 
    shows the measurement d = ??? mm<br><br>lock: allows simulating of the 
    lock function in real micrometer which disable changes to the position of 
    the spindle then by the measurement is unchangeable.<br><br>On the bottom 
    there is a green slider to control the position of the spindle, drag on 
    any part of the view also drags the spindle.<br><br>There is 2 buttons 
    left and right fine control to allow for single incremental change of the 
    measurement, to allow learners to sense the rotation simulation of the 
    spindle with the many lines to simulate the coarse pattern to increase 
    friction between fingers and on the thimble and ratchet.<br><br>The reset 
    button restores learning environment to default setting<br><br>
